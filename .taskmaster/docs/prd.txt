# Product Requirements Document: Fix Booking Draft API 500 Error

## Problem Statement
The `/api/bookings/draft` endpoint is returning 500 Internal Server Error, preventing users from creating or updating draft bookings in the Shalean Services booking system.

## Root Cause Analysis
Based on investigation of the codebase, the 500 error is likely caused by one or more of the following issues:

### 1. Environment Configuration Issues
- Supabase environment variables may not be properly configured
- The API checks for placeholder values in `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Fallback values are hardcoded in `env.server.ts` but may not be valid

### 2. Database Connection Issues
- Supabase client creation may be failing
- Database queries may be failing due to connection issues
- Missing or invalid service role key for server-side operations

### 3. Data Validation Issues
- Price calculation functions may be failing due to missing data
- Booking validation may be throwing unhandled errors
- Database constraints may be violated during insert/update operations

### 4. Authentication Issues
- Session ID generation for guest users may be failing
- Cookie handling for session management may have issues
- Bearer token authentication may not be working properly

## Success Criteria
- `/api/bookings/draft` endpoint returns 200 status for valid requests
- Draft bookings can be created successfully for both authenticated and guest users
- Draft bookings can be updated without errors
- Proper error handling with meaningful error messages
- All database operations complete successfully
- Price calculations work correctly when sufficient data is provided

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Ensure all required Supabase environment variables are properly set
- Remove hardcoded fallback values that may be invalid
- Add proper validation for environment variables
- Implement graceful degradation when environment is not fully configured

### 2. Error Handling Improvements
- Add comprehensive error logging with context
- Implement proper error responses with meaningful messages
- Add validation for all input parameters
- Handle database connection failures gracefully

### 3. Database Operations
- Ensure all database queries have proper error handling
- Add transaction support for complex operations
- Validate data before database operations
- Handle foreign key constraint violations

### 4. Authentication & Session Management
- Fix session ID generation and cookie handling
- Ensure proper authentication flow for both guest and authenticated users
- Add validation for authentication tokens
- Handle session expiration gracefully

### 5. Price Calculation
- Add error handling for price calculation functions
- Ensure price calculation doesn't fail the entire request
- Add fallback pricing when calculation fails
- Validate input data for price calculations

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Environment & Configuration Fixes
1. Review and fix environment variable configuration
2. Remove invalid hardcoded fallback values
3. Add proper environment validation
4. Test database connectivity

### Phase 2: Error Handling & Logging
1. Add comprehensive error logging throughout the API
2. Implement proper error response formatting
3. Add input validation for all endpoints
4. Test error scenarios

### Phase 3: Database & Authentication Fixes
1. Fix database connection issues
2. Improve authentication flow
3. Fix session management
4. Test with both guest and authenticated users

### Phase 4: Price Calculation & Validation
1. Fix price calculation error handling
2. Add proper data validation
3. Test price calculation scenarios
4. Ensure graceful degradation

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation
1. Test all API endpoints thoroughly
2. Test with various data scenarios
3. Test error conditions
4. Validate error messages are user-friendly

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `/api/bookings/draft` POST endpoint works without 500 errors
- [ ] `/api/bookings/draft` GET endpoint works without 500 errors
- [ ] Draft bookings can be created for guest users
- [ ] Draft bookings can be created for authenticated users
- [ ] Draft bookings can be updated successfully
- [ ] Price calculations work when sufficient data is provided
- [ ] Error messages are meaningful and helpful
- [ ] All database operations complete successfully
- [ ] Authentication works for both guest and authenticated users
- [ ] Session management works correctly

## Risk Mitigation
- Test changes in development environment first
- Implement comprehensive logging to identify issues quickly
- Add monitoring for API endpoint health
- Create rollback plan for production deployment
- Document all changes for future reference

## Dependencies
- Supabase database must be accessible
- Environment variables must be properly configured
- Database schema must be up to date
- Authentication system must be functional
