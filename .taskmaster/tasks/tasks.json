        "description": "Address the root cause of environment configuration issues by validating all Supabase-related environment variables at application startup and removing insecure, hardcoded fallbacks.",
        "details": "Locate all instances where environment variables are accessed (e.g., `env.server.ts`). Implement a validation schema using a library like Zod to parse `process.env`. The schema must enforce the presence and correct format for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. Remove any hardcoded fallback values. The application should fail fast on startup with a clear error message if any variable is missing or invalid. Update the `.env.example` file to be the single source of truth for required variables.\n<info added on 2025-09-21T16:57:01.417Z>\n**Analysis Update:**\nInitial analysis confirms critical issues in the current implementation:\n- **Hardcoded Fallbacks:** Insecure fallback values for the Supabase URL and anon key are present in both `env.server.ts` and `env.client.ts`. These must be removed.\n- **Inconsistent Schemas:** The server-side validation in `env.server.ts` incorrectly defines the Supabase variables as optional, contradicting the client-side validation and the application's requirements. The server schema must be updated to require these variables.\n- **Ineffective Placeholder Detection:** The draft API's check for placeholder values is currently bypassed by the hardcoded fallbacks, highlighting the existing risk.\n- **Missing Environment File:** No `.env` or `.env.example` file was found, confirming the need to create `.env.example` as part of this task.\n</info added on 2025-09-21T16:57:01.417Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-21T16:58:31.350Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-22T10:30:00.000Z>\n**Implementation Update:**\nThe initial implementation for robust environment variable handling is complete. The following changes have been made:\n- **Removed Hardcoded Fallbacks:** Insecure hardcoded values for the Supabase URL and anon key have been eliminated from both `src/env.server.ts` and `src/env.client.ts`.\n- **Strengthened Validation:** The server-side Zod schema in `src/env.server.ts` has been updated to make all Supabase variables mandatory, ensuring they are present at startup.\n- **Fail-Fast Mechanism:** The server-side environment loading (`src/env.server.ts`) is now wrapped in a `try-catch` block. If validation fails, it logs a clear error and exits the process (`process.exit(1)`), preventing the application from running with an invalid configuration.\n- **Created Single Source of Truth:** A new `env.example` file has been created and documented, serving as the definitive guide for all required environment variables.\n- **Refactored API Check:** The placeholder value check in the draft API route (`src/app/api/bookings/draft/route.ts`) has been removed and now relies on the centralized environment validation.\n\nThe next step is to execute the test strategy to verify that the application fails correctly when variables are missing and runs successfully with a valid configuration.\n</info added on 2025-09-22T10:30:00.000Z>\n</info added on 2025-09-21T16:58:31.350Z>",

Integrate a logging library like `pino` to produce structured JSON logs containing a request ID, user/session ID, and error stack trace. The handler must ensure the API always responds with a consistent JSON error object (e.g., `{ \"error\": { \"message\": \"...\" } }`) and the appropriate HTTP status code (4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors), replacing the generic 500 error page.\n<info added on 2025-09-21T17:02:19.381Z>\n**Implementation Summary:**\nA centralized error handling system has been implemented.\n- A new `ApiErrorHandler` class in `src/lib/api-error-handler.ts` is responsible for catching errors, setting the appropriate HTTP status code, and formatting a consistent JSON error response.\n- A structured JSON logger was configured in `src/lib/logger.ts`. It enriches logs with contextual data, including a unique `requestId` for tracing, user/session information, and request metadata.\n- The `/api/bookings/draft/route.ts` endpoint has been refactored to use this new system, wrapping its logic in a `try...catch` block that delegates to the `ApiErrorHandler`.

Refactor the database write operations into a Supabase RPC (database function) written in PL/pgSQL. The function will accept the draft data, begin a transaction, perform all inserts/updates, and commit. If any step fails, the entire transaction will be automatically rolled back. The API route will then simply call this single RPC.",
