## Data Quality Observations

### Issues Found
1. **Missing Slug Values**: All records have `slug: null` - the slug columns were added in migration but not populated
2. **Missing Price Cents**: `base_price_cents` and `price_cents` columns are null - these should be populated from the decimal price fields
3. **Inconsistent Pricing**: Some services use `base_price` (decimal) while the schema expects `base_price_cents` (integer)

### Schema Compliance
- All tables follow the expected structure from the migrations
- Foreign key relationships are properly established
- Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled on all tables
- Proper indexes are in place for performance

## Next Steps
1. Run the slug migration to populate slug values
2. Populate price_cents fields from decimal prices
3. Add sample data for empty tables (cleaners, bookings, etc.)
4. Test the API endpoints to ensure they work with the current data structure
